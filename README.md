# Tic_Tac_Toe
Project Description:
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, focusing on enhancing the gameplay experience. The game is built using a list-based board representation and includes features such as player turns, win/tie detection, and error handling for user input.

Key Features:
1. List-based board representation: The game board is represented using a list structure, allowing for easy manipulation and display of the game state.

2. Player Turns: The game alternates between "X" and "O" players, and upon ensuring that there is no winner, the game switches to the other player ensuring fair gameplay and turn-based interaction.

3. Win/Tie Detection: The code includes functions to check for winning combinations in rows, columns, and diagonals of the game board. It also detects ties when no more moves are possible.

4. Error Handling: User input is validated to ensure it falls within the valid range of 1-9 and that the chosen position is not already occupied. Error messages are displayed to guide the user in providing valid input.
